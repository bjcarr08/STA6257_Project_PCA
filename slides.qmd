## What is it? {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised machine learning method that can be used as the first step in data analysis
-   Main goal: reduce the number of dimensions/features while retaining most of the original variability
-   This is achieved using a vector space transform

## Why use PCA? {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   Makes it easier to graphically visualize hidden patterns in the data
-   High number of predictor variables or highly correlated variables when running a regression model
-   To observe hidden trends, jumps, clusters, patterns and outliers
-   PCA assumes no distribution in data in a descriptive context
-   Widely adaptive as an exploratory method across disciplines and data types

## Where has PCA been applied? {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   PCA is a broadly used statistical method whose use stretches across many scientific disciplines
-   Image analysis, analysis of web data, cyber security analysis, mental disorders, recognizing microanerysm, facial recognition, etc.
-   Many different adaptations of PCA have been developed based on the variation in goals and data types associated with each respective discipline

## How does it work? {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   By mathematical projection we can interpret the original data set with just a few variables, namely the principal components
-   The process of reduction preserves the maximum variability in the data (i.e. the statistical information present in the data)
-   "...find new variables that are linear functions of those in the original data set, that successively maximize variance and that are uncorrelated with each other" [@Jolliffe]

## Methods {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   PCA forms the basis of multivariate data analysis based on projection methods
-   Variability in the original (correlated) variables is explained through a smaller (uncorrelated) set of new variables i.e. the principal components (PC's)
-   For un-scaled data calculations should either be preformed on the correlation matrix (instead of the covariance matrix)
-   Data should be standardized with mean 0 and variance 1 (z scores)
-   A new set of orthogonal coordinate axes are identified from the original data set
-   Accomplished by finding the direction of maximal variance through each dimension
-   Equivalent to using the least squares method
-   This new axis is the first principal component of the data set
-   Next, orthogonal projection is used to project the coordinates onto the new axis
-   Obtain a second principal component (and principal coordinate axis) by finding the direction of the second largest variance in the data, orthogonal to our first PC
-   These two PCs define a plane onto which we can project further coordinates onto

## Conclusion {background-color="#FAFAF5"}

-   PCA is a very powerful tool for data analysis. It allows us to see patterns and trends hidden in large sets of data that would otherwise be very difficult to make out.

. . .

-   In our conclusion of Data, we saw that Scree-plot Proportion of Variance 0.4256 0.2027 0.09081 0.0669 0.06306 0.05966 0.05214 0.03907 and as well that plot dropped 10% from variances after Comp 3.

. . .

-   We focus on the Assumptions we ensure the variables are continuous, intervals or ratio levels of measurements are also of the same scale and units.

. . .

-   We also make sure in our dataset that the variables are linearly related, and we use the scatterplot to check the variables. Lastly, we ensure Outliers are removed and those Null values that are missing are noted and removed

. . .

-   PCA has been found to be useful when performing k-means clustering which by itself is a clustering method with countless applications. With all of the flexibility and usefulness of PCA taken into consideration it is easy to see why it is such a popular way to analyze large data sets across so many fields.

. . .

-   As long as there are large data sets there will be a demand to reduce the dimension of that data and make valid interpretations about the trends present in that data, to this end we have PCA.
