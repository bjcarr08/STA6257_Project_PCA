## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Intro

Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods. In our research, we learn the applications of how important and groundbreaking Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods are. In these papers we see how promising the impact is of PCA with recognizing Microanerysm in medicine and how groundbreaking has been critical for diagnosis and treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy. Other research papers show a framework for coronary artery disease risk assessment in intravascular ultrasound. The paper reflects on a novel strategy for risk stratification based on plaque morphology embedded with principal component analysis (PCA) for plaque feature dimensionality reduction and dominant feature selection technique.\[\@Gorg2021\] Facial recognition with PCA and machine learning methods, From this Paper the authors have identified that the best way to compare and evaluate the Facial Recognition results with speed and accuracy was with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM). Lastly we see the importance of PCA with it identifying that the best way to compare and evaluate the Facial Recognition results with speed and accuracy was with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM)\[\@Camargo\].
